```

  Response:

```plaintext

  The main issues highlighted in the reviews are:


  1. Issues with Google's handling of business listings, including allowing competitors to hijack listings and suspending legitimate listings when changes are made.

  2. Complaints about fake reviews on Google and the lack of action taken to remove them upon request.

  3. Frustration with Google Ads, including automatic billing without consent, charging for events that have already finished, and poor customer service.

  4. Positive feedback on Google's office in Sydney and its amenities.

  5. Positive feedback on working for Google and its benefits. 


  To improve, the business should address the issues raised in the negative reviews, particularly the handling of business listings and fake reviews, and improve customer service for Google Ads. Positive feedback on amenities and benefits should be maintained and highlighted to potential customers and employees.
